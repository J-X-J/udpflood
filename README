udpflood is a small command line utility, which can create and send udp packets
filled with random data to a specified target. It's ipv6 ready and very easy to
use, command line switches:

-t target
	the target hostname or ipv4/ipv6 address

-c count
	the count of threads to spawn, optional, default is 5

-b buffer
	the send buffer size in kilobytes, optional

-6
	enable ipv6 mode and resolve hostname to AAAA record

-p port
	the port to penetrate, optional, default is 9 (discard service)


Please report any bugs to <nefarius@dhmx.at> and happy flooding! =)
